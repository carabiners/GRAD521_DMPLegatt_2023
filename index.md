# Data Description
As a topic of fluid-structure interaction, it is desirable to understand interactions between fuel and coolant. Too much movement has undesirable effects on performance. To study fluid-structure interaction in the lab, experiments are performed.

The data is experimentally obtained and focused on the measured valued of: distance to a surface and movement of the surface. Multiple methods are used to make the measurement and multiple types of data are generated from these methods including: formatted text files and images. Some files use a format that is described in a file provided with the data set. Other files are in a format that is not specified in the dataset and is obtained elsewhere. 

Once data is generated, varying amounts of data processing is required to convert the raw data into useful data. Data processing involves use of multiple scripts written in multiple codes. The amount of data generated in a test varies form a few MB to many GB.

# Roles and Responsibilities
As I learn how to make tables in markdown language, this section is a work in progress. Grad student 1 has all but one of the reponsibilities. Responsibilities include: DMP implementation, access control, data manager, data organization, data protection, data archiving and preservation, data documentation, data collection, data quality control, maintenance of resources, data analysis, knowledge transition, and communication.

Here is the table so far: 
-Role -Performed By -Reponsibilities
